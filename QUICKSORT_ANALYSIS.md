# Quick Sort Analysis - PR #6 Review

## Pull Request Review: "add-images-to-quicksort-algorithm-page"

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Comment:** Nothing changed with quick sort.

## Analysis Summary

The pull request #6 claimed to "add images to quicksort algorithm page" but upon thorough analysis:

### Findings:
- **No images added**: No image files (png, jpg, gif, svg) exist in the repository
- **No image references**: No image references found in quicksort-related files:
  - `algorithms/quickSort.js`  
  - `algorithms/quickSort.nomod.js`
  - `sorting/quick_sort.py`
- **No algorithmic changes**: Quicksort implementations remain unchanged and fully functional
- **Standard implementation**: Both JavaScript and Python versions use standard Lomuto partition scheme

### Verification:
- ✅ Python implementation runs successfully with test cases
- ✅ JavaScript implementation properly integrated with web visualizer  
- ✅ All quicksort functionality works as expected
- ❌ No images or visual enhancements were added

## Conclusion

**Nothing changed with quick sort.**

The PR title was misleading - no images were added to the quicksort algorithm page, and no modifications were made to the quicksort algorithm implementations or functionality.
